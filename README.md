# get-title

## What's this?
A VERY simple Rust program using the small `ureq` and `scraper` crates for sending HTTP requests and parsing the title of the given URL

## Installtion (think twice)
```
cd get-title
cargo build
./target/debug/get-title "https://spookysec.me"
```

## Why?
I'm currently learning Rust... best way to do that is through projects
